# ManualTesting
what is manual testing
Testing made by hand, when the tester enteres testData by hand, not automated
We write testCases by hand then we write test scripts using testManagementSystems like WebDriver, TestLink, TestRail .....to automate the tests !!!
First we write the test then we automate the tests >
Conclusion -Manually testing will never die, it will always exist, UI, UX testing can be done only manually, automation is not always possible !!! and priceConsistent!!!
